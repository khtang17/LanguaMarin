<h2>Adult Students</h2>

    <p>Group classes have a maximum of six students each, so that each
        student receives personal attention. Classes
        start in September (fall term) and February
        (spring term). Classes do start at other times
        corresponding to the needs of our students. Students can join
        classes at any time of the year and tuition is pro-rated.</p>
